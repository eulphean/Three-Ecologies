# Three-Ecologies
 This project was developed as part of a commission by the artist Jaclyn Jacunski for the 2019 Terrain Biennial in Chicago. Amay was engaged to create an interactive real-time live-streaming project, which showed the entire text called Three Ecologies by Felix Guattari as subtitles on top of the work.
